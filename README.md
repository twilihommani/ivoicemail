# Twilio voiceMail
## Let's play
This small applicaton intend to illustrate the use of twilio API.
The aim of the application is to give a personnal answer to each of your contact according the number
the application receives.  

## Use case
Let's say you can't answer your phone becouse you're on vacation.Your dad and one of your friend call.  
They'll receive the classical "I'm not there, please leave your message after the bip sound..." .  
Wouldn't it be more fun to allow more personalisation ?
For instance "Hey Elliot, glad you call I'm on vacation now, but you still can reach me with my email." for your friend and "Hey dad! What's up I'm coming back August the second. We're having fun!" for your dad.
And so on.   

That's the goal of the application. To give you the possibility to choose the voice mail message according who is calling you.
